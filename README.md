# The Weather

Don't get caught off guard by the weather! Check the forecast for your current location easily using Geolocation. Or, if you prefer, you can manually search for weather updates anywhere else. Forecasts are updated hourly and include details on conditions, precipitation, and wind, all presented in a format that suits you. Additionally, enjoy dynamic background imagery provided by Unsplash, which matches current weather conditions - somewhat reliably.

## Design

The Weather boasts a minimalist and clutter-free design complemented by dynamic background images. I particularly enjoyed the custom precipitation icon, which gradually fills based on the percentage during wetter days in the hourly forecast. However, there's room for improvement in the sliders themselves, as they can feel a bit clunky when manipulated on a desktop.
