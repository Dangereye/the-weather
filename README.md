# The Weather

Check the forecast where you are - using Geolocation. Alternatively, perform manual searches - elsewhere! Forecasts include conditions, precipitation and wind (displayed hourly) in a format that suits you. The presentation includes dynamic imagery, courtesy of Unsplash - which matches
(somewhat reliably) current weather conditions.

## Design

The Weather has a minimalistic, clutter-free design with dynamic background images. I was especially pleased with the custom precipitation icon that fills by percentage during wetter days (hourly forecast). The sliders themselves could use an update - they feel a little clunky when actioned via desktop.
